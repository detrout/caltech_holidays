* Introduction

I was tired of reading the Caltech HR's site for knowing when we have holidays.

This program reads the page and writes out a iCalendar file.

It's probably not useful unless you work at Caltech.

* Changelog
** 2025

I got tired of the previous years vanishing, and now it will load the
previous icalendar file and add the latest year to it. So you can see
when the holidays were some time ago.

I had to change how the UID is calculated to make it more
deterministic, so now there's a warning for the old UIDs.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
python3 caltech_holidays.py
scp caltech_holidays.ics webserver:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Or the way I'm using it is in a cron file that runs once per month

#+begin_example
# m h  dom mon dow   command
2 3 1 * * python3 ~/bin/caltech_holidays.py --icalendar ~/public_html/caltech-holidays.ics
#+end_example
